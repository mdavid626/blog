Who is a power user? According to Google:

> Power user: a knowledgeable and sophisticated user of computers.

If you consider yourself a sophisticated computer user, then you should know the following Windows commands:

<!--more-->

- Device Manager: `devmgmt.msc`
- Disk Management: `diskmgmg.msc`
- Certificates Current User: `certmgr.msc`
- Services: `services.msc`
- MMC Console: `mmc`
- Programs and Features: `appwiz.cpl`
- Network Connections: `ncpa.cpl`
- Sign out: `logoff`
- Shutdown: `shutdown /s /t 0`
- Restart: `shutdown /r /t 0`
- Paint: `mspaint`
- Calculator: `calc`
- About Windows: `winver`
- File Explorer: `explorer`
- Task Manager: `taskmgr`
- Remote Desktop Connection: `mstsc`

So, you won't have to click through dozens of windows again to open the `Network Connections` dialog. Hit `Win+R` and type `ncpa.cpl`. And your done.

You want the old `Programs and Features` back, but Windows 10 is showing you the new UWP style feature-less unfinished `App & features` window? You don't even find the `Control panel` anymore? Don't worry. Run `appwiz.cpl`. Here you go. Thank me later.
