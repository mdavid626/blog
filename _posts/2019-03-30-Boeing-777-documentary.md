If you are into [Lean manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) and [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_product_development), you should watch this beautiful documentary about the development and manufacturing of the [Boeing 777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777) aircraft from 1996. It took 5 years and 5 billion dollars to build it from scratch. Ten thousand people worked on it together under [Alan Mulally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally). He created an entirely new management system for the Boeing 777 program. Mulally focused his energies on Working Together: design/build teams were created with members from design, manufacturing, suppliers, and customer airlines. There were no secrets in the teams, everyone was urged "share early and share often". The management system was based on [W. Edwards Deming's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) book [Out of the Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Crisis-Press-Edwards-Deming/dp/0262541157) and [14 Points](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/demings-14-points/).

The documentary has 5 episodes, each around one hour long.
